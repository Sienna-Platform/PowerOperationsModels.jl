#=
Buses that must survive PNM network reductions because something the template models
is pinned to them. One rule per method.

This set is the sole authority on reduction exceptions: the buses the caller pinned on the
`NetworkModel` plus the buses these rules derive. PNM's own `_collect_protected_buses`
protects every system Outage; this protects only what the template actually models, so a
contingency the model never enforces cannot block a reduction.

The declaration of which network a NetworkModel is built on. `_build_ybus` is the
single place a Ybus is constructed during network model instantiation: one Ybus per
build means one reduction, so every matrix derived from it agrees by construction.
=#

"""
Build the network from the system, applying `reductions`, honoring the build's
reduction exceptions, and sparsifying the derived sensitivity matrices at `tolerance`.
The two are independent knobs on the same construction step.

`tolerance` is the per-row sparsification cutoff handed to `PNM.VirtualFactorCore`: a
`Float64` is an absolute cutoff, a `PNM.AutoTolerance` a relative, size-adaptive one.
It reaches every matrix wrapping that core — PTDF and MODF alike. The default is PNM's
own auto rule, so POM does not second-guess it with a fixed cutoff of its own.

A zero-impedance branch reduction is always applied first. Include a
`ZeroImpedanceBranchReduction` to override its parameters; it replaces that step rather than
adding one, so its position in the vector is irrelevant. More than one errors.

Reuse a `VirtualPTDF` the caller already built, including its populated row cache.
Its own reduction becomes the build's reduction; the reduction exceptions derived
from the template are not applied, because the matrix already exists.

Only a `VirtualPTDF` is accepted: it carries the factorization core, so a MODF
sharing its reduction can be derived from it. A dense `PNM.PTDF` carries no core and
is deliberately not a valid source.

# Native DCPLL network formulation. Same bus/balance structure as DCP (voltage angles,
# reference-bus pinning, active nodal balance). Branch losses are handled by directional
# flow variables + a quadratic loss constraint in the branch construction path.
# VoltageAngle is added in the ArgumentConstructStage (network_constructor.jl generic
# method); this ModelConstructStage method closes the balance/reference constraints.

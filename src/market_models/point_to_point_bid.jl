A spread bid prices a single award, so the offer direction is a pure function of the
formulation and the one-argument trait suffices. Incremental is the economically correct
side: the cleared quantity `q` injects at `to` and withdraws at `from`, so the system saving
from a marginal MW is the `to`-minus-`from` price spread, and a convex increasing cost term
`C(q)` clears the bid up to `C'(q) = spread`. That is exactly a willingness-to-pay curve on
the spread, and it matches PSY's "incremental side only" contract for `spread_bid`.

Argument stage for `SpreadBid`: a point-to-point spread bid is one cleared quantity at two
locations with opposite signs, a withdrawal at `from` and an injection at `to`. The two
`add_cleared_position!` writes are the whole model of the instrument. Because they cancel
and each location's factor set is what distributes them, the bid contributes nothing net
system-wide and moves the solution only through the nodal pattern, which is what an
up-to-congestion bid is. It is excluded from `SettlementBalance` outright: its two settlement
terms would cancel exactly, so writing them would add non-zero entries for no effect. A
terminal type without a `NodalRedistribution` component model in the template fails loudly
on the missing `AggregateClearedInjection` container.

The stage also adds the incremental PWL parameters a time-series-backed `spread_bid` is
priced against in the model stage.

Model stage for `SpreadBid`: the willingness-to-pay curve on the `to`-minus-`from` spread
(`PSY.get_spread_bid`, reached through `IOM.get_operation_cost`) becomes the bid's objective
term through the standard incremental PWL path, so the bid clears up to the quantity where
its marginal bid price meets the cleared spread instead of clearing free.

Two independent quantities bound the award and the tighter one binds: the
`max_active_power` envelope, which bounds the variable directly, and the offer curve's own
top breakpoint, which bounds it through the PWL delta constraint. Authoring them to
different values is legitimate (the curve is the offer), so they are not validated against
each other as `VirtualBidDispatch`'s block bids are.

A MULTI_STEP bid (`curve_multistep`) also gets [`BlockBidLinkConstraint`](@ref) rows tying
consecutive periods with identical spread curves to one cleared MW
(`_add_spread_bid_link_rows!`). Everything else about the instrument is its two signed
position writes from the argument stage.

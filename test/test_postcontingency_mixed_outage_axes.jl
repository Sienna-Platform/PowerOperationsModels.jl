# Ported from PowerSimulations.jl PR #1579 (MODF SCUC migration), adapted to
# POM / PS6 APIs. Exercises the Phase-4 `_build_device_model_outages!` planned
# vs. unplanned outage-axis selection and the
# `_add_outage_monitored_irreducible_buses!` bus-pinning (N3) logic.
#
# Adaptation notes:
#   * internal symbols are namespaced `POM.` / `IOM.` / `PNM.`; expression and
#     constraint accessors take the *type* (no instance `()`), matching POM's
#     `IOM.get_expression(container, POM.X, T)` convention.
#   * the planned/unplanned distinction is driven by the
#     `"include_planned_outages"` DeviceModel attribute (Phase 2 seeds it to
#     `false` in `get_default_attributes(::AbstractSecurityConstrainedStaticBranch)`).
#   * the upstream "outages kwarg selects a subset" sub-testset is DEFERRED: the
#     IOM `DeviceModel(...; outages)` kwarg is typed
#     `AbstractVector{<:IS.InfrastructureSystemsComponent}`, but outage objects
#     (`GeometricDistributionForcedOutage` / `PlannedOutage`) are
#     `IS.SupplementalAttribute`s, a sibling branch of
#     `InfrastructureSystemsType`, so they are rejected at construction
#     (TypeError). The explicit-subset selection path is therefore not
#     representable through the public constructor; the auto-discovery + planned
#     filter path is the portable one and is exercised in full below.
#   * for the bus-pinning unit tests we populate `IOM.get_outages(dm)` directly
#     (the same dict `_assign_outage_to_sc_models!` writes), since the kwarg
#     cannot accept the supplemental attribute.

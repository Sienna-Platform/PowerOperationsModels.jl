# Parallel test runner. Each top-level `test_*.jl` file runs in its OWN isolated Julia

#   julia --project=test test/runtests.jl --jobs=4         # cap parallelism
#   julia --project=test test/runtests.jl --list           # list discoverable tests
#
# NOTE: the previous serial runner asserted "no Error-level log events across the whole
# run" via a single global MultiLogger. That global assertion does not carry to
# per-worker isolation and has been dropped; the per-`@test`/`@testset` assertions
# inside each file still run and gate the result.

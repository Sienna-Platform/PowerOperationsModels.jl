# Phase 2 (not started here) would replace POM's per-branch admittance derivation
# (`PNM.branch_admittance` / `PNM.get_series_susceptance`, in `AC_branches.jl`) with
# per-arc reads off the `Ybus` and its `VirtualFactorCore`. Both paths derive from the
# same device data and the same reduction, so this test is the gate: it checks whether
# they actually agree before any builder is allowed to switch over.
#
# `PNM.YBUS_ELTYPE = ComplexF32` (definitions.jl:1): `Ybus.data`, and therefore
# `ArcAdmittanceMatrix`/`BA_Matrix`/`VirtualFactorCore.arc_susceptances` derived from it, carry
# only single-precision values even though their containers are declared `Float64`. The
# per-branch route (`get_series_susceptance` on the device's own `Float64` r/x) has no such
# limit. `rtol = 1e-6` is not arbitrary slack: it is ~10x the largest relative error measured
# (9.2e-8, consistent with Float32's ~1.2e-7 unit roundoff) across every case/reduction below,
# so it still fails loudly on a genuine formula divergence while tolerating the known storage
# truncation.
#
# NOT exercised here: a parallel branch group with r != 0 on any member. Both fixtures'
# parallel arcs are loss-free, so `get_series_susceptance(::AbstractBranchesParallel)`'s
# `sum(1/x_i)` (correct only when r_i == 0) is never checked against the impedance-correct
# combination BA_Matrix computes from the summed complex Ybus entry; a real disagreement there
# could be hiding under the Float32 noise floor this test already tolerates.

# Series phase shift has no per-arc accessor: it is recoverable in principle from
# `angle(arc_admittance_from_to[arc, to_bus] / arc_admittance_to_from[arc, from_bus]) / 2`
# (the two ArcAdmittanceMatrix coupling terms, per `_pi_to_ybus`'s `Y12 = -Y_l*e^{jα}/tap`,
# `Y21 = -Y_l*e^{-jα}/tap`), but PNM exposes no function that does this — a caller would have
# to index `ArcAdmittanceMatrix.data` directly via `get_arc_lookup`/`get_bus_lookup`. Phase 2
# must keep `PNM.get_series_phase_shift` as a per-branch call.
